Creating a new account will put you right into the action and have you playing the game! The same is true if you login as well.

From here you can either go back to the main menu or hop into a game!
>*Note: If you have not logged in and decide to play from the leaderboard your score will not be saved


## Playing the Game
Now that you are down in the mud, lets get into playing the game!

The game will start with a random category that is displayed at the top right and all the current cards are arranged in the center of your screen.

The game plays out as a normal memory game where you click on an object to reveal the card and two correctly matching cards will cause them to stay face up. Once all cards are face up the game will end. 

Any score will be saved to the leaderboard.
